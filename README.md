# Account Safe

A simple and secure app to store all your passwords in one place

With <b>Account Safe</b>, you can store all your account passwords safely in a secure encrypted form. A master password is used as an encryption key for the passwords.

As this app doesn't have internet access, it is fully secure.

This app supports multiple users. Up to 10 users can use the same app and have their own user account with master password.

### Features
 - Multi-user support
 - No internet permission
 - Encryption using SHA256 hash
 - Backup your passwords to local storage
 - Strong password generator built in
 - Easily copy password to clipboard
 - Customizable theme

### Points to note
 - If you lose or forget your master password, all passwords will be lost and will not be recoverable.
 - In case of data loss, such as when the app is uninstalled or switched devices, it is recommended to make regular backups of your user account so that the data can be recovered.
